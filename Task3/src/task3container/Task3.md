# 🎮 Number Guessing Game

## 📌 Internship Project – Task 3

**Role:** Java Programmer Intern
**Organization:** Kodbud
**Developer:** Code-Domain

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Number Guessing Game** is a console-based interactive Java application designed to simulate a logical number prediction system.

Developed as part of my Java Programmer Internship at **Kodbud**, this project demonstrates the practical implementation of Core Java fundamentals including control flow mechanisms, input validation, random number generation, and structured program design.

The application allows users to select either a default guessing range or define a custom range. A random number is generated within the selected boundaries, and the user must guess the number with the system providing guided hints until the correct number is identified.

This project focuses on writing clean, structured, and logically organized Java code while applying professional resource management practices.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

* Design a structured console-based game system
* Implement menu-driven program flow
* Apply logical validation techniques
* Generate random numbers dynamically
* Practice structured looping and condition handling
* Apply proper resource management using modern Java practices

---

## ✨ Key Functionalities

### 🔹 Game Configuration

* Default guessing range (1–50)
* Custom range selection
* Validation for incorrect range inputs
* Safe exit option

### 🔹 Gameplay Mechanics

* Random number generation within selected range
* Continuous guessing until correct answer
* Hint system (Higher / Lower guidance)
* Attempt counter tracking number of guesses
* Input validation for out-of-range guesses

### 🔹 Resource Management

* Implementation of `try-with-resources`
* Automatic closure of `Scanner` object
* Exception-safe input handling

---

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### 🔹 Programming Language

* Java

### 🔹 Core Technologies

* `ThreadLocalRandom` → Random number generation
* `Scanner` → Console input handling
* `try-with-resources` → Automatic resource management

## 🧠 Core Concepts Demonstrated

### 🔸 Object-Oriented Programming

* Class structure design
* Main method execution flow
* Variable scope handling
* Encapsulation of game logic

### 🔸 Control Flow Mechanisms

* `do-while` loop for menu system
* `while` loop for gameplay execution
* Conditional statements (`if–else`)
* Logical operators (`&&`, `||`)
* Early validation using `continue`

### 🔸 Input & Validation Handling

* Dynamic user input
* Range validation
* Preventing invalid guesses
* Logical separation of validation and comparison

### 🔸 Random Number Generation

* Usage of `ThreadLocalRandom`
* Generating bounded random integers
* Ensuring inclusive upper bound

## 🎲 Game Logic Flow

1. Display main menu.
2. User selects default range, custom range, or exit.
3. Validate range input.
4. Generate random number within selected range.
5. Prompt user for guess.
6. Validate guess range.
7. Provide hint (Higher / Lower).
8. Track attempt count.
9. End game when correct number is guessed.
